## My Beginnings in Programming üñ•Ô∏è

In 2014, I entered high school and decided to take the Programming Technician career. In the first semester, as an integral project, I knew I wanted to make a video game, so I committed to doing it. I learned to use **Unity**, delved deeper into **Blender**, and a bit into **C#**. It was an arduous process, as no one on my team knew how to program, but with their help, we all learned a bit more and managed to complete the project. We delivered a functional demo of a character in a scenario in our 3D _survival_ type game. It was at that moment that I discovered that making a video game is not easy at all and understood the magnitude of knowledge, time, and dedication needed.
